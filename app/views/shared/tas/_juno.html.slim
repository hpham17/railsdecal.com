| Hi, I'm Juno. I'm a second year intended CS major (also thinking of cog sci). In my spare time I like to produce music, browse soundcloud, go hiking, play smash (melee), play guitar, once in a while I paint, and I also spend an embarrassing amount of time watching youtube reviews of cars I will most likeley never be able to afford. I think Rails is cool because it gives you all the tools you need to turn an idea into reality. Hope you enjoy the course!
